1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,695
PRINCE CHARMING
Onward, Chauncey!

2
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:58,429
PRINCE CHARMING
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:03,668
PRINCE CHARMING
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Charming!

4
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:18,787
GINGERBREAD MAN
This is worse than "Love Letters".
I hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,688
PINOCCHIO
Me, too.

6
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,019
PRINCE CHARMING
Whoa there, Chauncey!

7
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,889
ACTRESS
Hark! The brave Prince Charming
approacheth.

8
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:33,404
PRINCE CHARMING
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,475
PRINCE CHARMING
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:38,201
OLD LADY
What did she say?

11
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,380
AUDIENCE
It's Shrek!

12
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,311
AUDIENCE
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,647
PRINCE CHARMING
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,453
PRINCE CHARMING
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,154
WAITER
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

16
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:58,559
PRINCE CHARMING
Do you mind?

17
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:02,061
GINGERBREAD MAN
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,905
PRINCE CHARMING
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,613
PRINCE CHARMING
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:22,914
AUDIENCE
We already are!

21
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,344
PRINCE CHARMING
Mommy...

22
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,778
PRINCE CHARMING
You're right. I can't let this happen.

23
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:58,955
PRINCE CHARMING
I can't!

24
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:03,892
PRINCE CHARMING
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,123
PRINCE CHARMING
And I promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,196
PRINCE CHARMING
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:14,898
PRINCE CHARMING
And this time,

28
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,205
PRINCE CHARMING
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,823
SHREK
Good morning.

30
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,492
FIONA
Good morning.

31
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:43,192
FIONA
Morning breath.

32
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:46,499
SHREK
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:49,004
DONKEY
Good morning, good morning

34
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,076
DONKEY
The sun is shining through

35
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,406
DONKEY
Good morning, good morning
To you

36
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,674
DONKEY
And you!
And you!

37
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:02,281
DONKEY
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,515
SHREK
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:09,288
PUSS
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,626
PUSS
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

41
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:16,064
SHREK
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:19,035
DONKEY
Come on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:22,136
DONKEY
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:32,813
SHREK
I got some sleep and I needed it

45
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:35,682
SHREK
Not a lot, just a little bit

46
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,916
SHREK
Someone's always
trying to keep me from it

47
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,891
SHREK
It's a crying shame

48
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,928
SHREK
It's a royal pain in the neck

49
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,725
SHREK
I knight thee.

50
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:11,716
DONKEY
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

51
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,918
DONKEY
Can somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

52
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:18,253
RAUL
I will see what I can do.

53
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,113
PUSS
Yeah, wow.

54
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:44,445
FIONA
Is this really necessary?

55
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,885
RAUL
Quite necessary, Fiona.

56
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,824
SHREK
- I'm Shrek, you twit.

57
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:53,659
PUSS
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

58
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,734
DONKEY
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

59
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:59,326
SHREK
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

60
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,407
FIONA
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

61
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:04,567
FIONA
It's just until Dad gets better.

62
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:07,977
FIONA
Shrek?

63
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:10,907
FIONA
You look handsome.

64
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,984
SHREK
Come here, you.

65
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,997
SHREK
My butt is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

66
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,774
SHREK
Hey, you! Come here. What's your name?

67
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:38,274
FIDDLESWORTH
Fiddlesworth, sir.

68
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,503
SHREK
Perfect.

69
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,547
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,847
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

71
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,954
SHREK
Ahh! You've got it.

72
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,617
SHREK
A little to the left.

73
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,058
SHREK
That's it! That's good.

74
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:02,292
SHREK
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

75
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,868
FIONA
Shrek!

76
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:09,900
DONKEY
My eye!

77
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,202
WOMAN
What are you doing?

78
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:18,772
SHREK
Fiona!

79
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:25,119
SHREK & FIONA
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

80
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:31,060
DONKEY
Shrimp! My favorite!

81
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:44,270
SHREK & FIONA
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Calm down.

82
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,347
SHREK
Calm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

83
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:53,077
SHREK
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

84
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,521
DONKEY
I think that went well.

85
00:07:58,658 --> 00:07:59,886
SHREK
Donkey!

86
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:01,755
DONKEY
Come on, Shrek!

87
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:05,492
PUSS
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

88
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:19,370
FIONA
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

89
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,811
FIONA
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

90
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,850
FIONA
...and filled with the rotting stench
of mud and neglect.

91
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,613
SHREK
You had me at "vermin-filled".

92
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:34,290
FIONA
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

93
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,490
SHREK
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

94
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,995
FIONA
Uh, no.

95
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,828
FIONA
What I'm thinking of is a little bigger
than a swamp rat.

96
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:43,993
SHREK
Donkey?

97
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:47,799
FIONA
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

98
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,202
FIONA
...they were little ogre feet?

99
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,017
SHREK
Honey, let's be rational about this.

100
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:03,519
SHREK
Have you seen a baby lately?

101
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:06,853
SHREK
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

102
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:10,360
SHREK
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

103
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,294
SHREK
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

104
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:17,232
SHREK
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

105
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,965
FIONA
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

106
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,668
SHREK
Right now, you're my family.

107
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,842
SHREK
Somebody better be dying.

108
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,015
KING HAROLD
I'm dying.

109
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,516
QUEEN
Harold?

110
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,787
KING HAROLD
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

111
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,863
QUEEN
Of course, darling.

112
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,658
KING HAROLD
Fiona.

113
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,325
FIONA
Yes, Daddy?

114
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:53,199
KING HAROLD
I know I made many mistakes with you.

115
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:55,673
FIONA
It's okay.

116
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:57,935
KING HAROLD
But your love for Shrek has...

117
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:00,277
KING HAROLD
...taught me much.

118
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,406
KING HAROLD
My dear boy...

119
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,815
KING HAROLD
...I am proud to call you my son.

120
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:11,081
SHREK
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

121
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:13,657
SHREK
...King dad-in-law.

122
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:19,390
KING HAROLD
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

123
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,734
PUSS
The Frog King... is dead.

124
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,888
DONKEY
Put your hat back on, fool.

125
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,614
KING HAROLD
Shrek...

126
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,418
KING HAROLD
...please come hither.

127
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:51,627
SHREK
Yeah, Dad?

128
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,927
KING HAROLD
This kingdom needs a new king.

129
00:10:56,268 --> 00:11:00,932
KING HAROLD
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

130
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:06,806
SHREK
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

131
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:10,279
SHREK
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

132
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:17,650
SHREK
Come on, Dad. An ogre as king?

133
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,315
SHREK
That's not such a good idea.

134
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,758
SHREK
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

135
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:29,095
KING HAROLD
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

136
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,432
SHREK
Really? Who is he, Dad?

137
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:34,630
KING HAROLD
His name is...

138
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,066
KING HAROLD
...is...

139
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,836
SHREK
What's his name?

140
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,570
KING HAROLD
...is...

141
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,573
FIONA
Daddy!

142
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,801
KING HAROLD
His name is Arthur.

143
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,334
SHREK
Arthur?

144
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,871
KING HAROLD
I know you'll do...

145
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,673
KING HAROLD
...what's right.

146
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,047
QUEEN
Harold?

147
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,743
SHREK
Dad? Dad!

148
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:23,416
SHREK
Dad?

149
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,615
DONKEY
Do your thing, man.

00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,719
MUSIC
~ Was an open book ~ 

152
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:07,859
~ You used to say live and let live ~ 

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,333
~ You know you did, you know you did
You know you did ~ 

154
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:17,200
~ But if this ever changing world
In which we live in ~ 

155
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:22,241
~ Makes you give in and cry ~ 

156
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,911
~ Say live and let die ~ 

157
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,017
~ Live and let die ~ 

158
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:12,293
~ Hey, lady
You, lady ~ 

159
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,460
~ Cursing at your life ~ 

160
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,797
~ You're a discontented mother ~ 

161
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:23,134
And a regimented wife ~ 

162
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,997
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

163
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,034
Ah, Mabel!

164
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:59,577
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

165
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,773
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

166
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,682
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

167
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,380
What do you want, Charming?

168
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:15,584
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

169
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,663
And a Fuzzy Navel.

170
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,857
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

171
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:27,932
We're not your friends.

172
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,269
You don't belong here.

173
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:36,575
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

174
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,342
Do a number on his face.

175
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:43,080
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

176
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:47,124
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

177
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,351
Oh, what's it to you?

178
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,758
They left you the unfairest of them all.

179
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:55,424
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

180
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,398
How does that feel?

181
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,467
pretty unfair.

182
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,009
And you!

183
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:10,775
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

184
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:14,377
I hate that little wooden puppet.

185
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,488
And Hook.

186
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,214
Need I say more?

187
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,691
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

188
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,458
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

189
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:33,770
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your little fat foot...

190
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,806
...into that tiny glass slipper?

191
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:42,004
Cinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

192
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:47,175
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

193
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,787
...that has ever done you wrong!

194
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:54,859
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

195
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,860
But there are
two sides to every story...

196
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,555
...and our side has not been told!

197
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:05,568
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

198
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:07,365
Who wants their...

199
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:10,669
..."happily ever after"?

200
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,521
This way, gents.

201
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:45,901
It's out of my hands, se�orita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

202
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:49,844
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

203
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,416
As are you.

204
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,917
And, uh, you.

205
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,216
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

206
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:00,722
I got to go!

207
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,822
I don't wanna leave you either.

208
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,795
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

209
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,066
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

210
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,769
Be strong, babies.

211
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,340
Coco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

212
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:20,468
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

213
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,108
That's my special boy!

214
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:27,343
Come here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

215
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:35,257
Shrek?

216
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:40,561
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

217
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:44,226
Come on. There's no way
I could ever run a kingdom.

218
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:47,361
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

219
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:50,031
It's not that, no. You see...

220
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:54,635
And if he gives me any trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

221
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,113
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

222
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,918
Fiona...

223
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:05,319
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

224
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:07,118
...and our swamp.

225
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,452
It's not going to be just you and me.

226
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,631
All aboard!

227
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,634
It will be. I promise.

228
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,295
I love you.

229
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,574
That's lovely.

230
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:31,307
Bye-bye, babies!

231
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,084
Shrek!

232
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,521
- Wait!
- What is it?

233
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,152
I'm... I'm...

234
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,032
I love you, too, honey!

235
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,002
No! I said I'm...

236
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,442
You're what?

237
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:01,011
I said I'm pregnant!

238
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,650
What was that?

239
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:09,845
You're going to be a father!

240
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,487
That's great!

241
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,890
Really? I'm glad you think so!

242
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,428
I love you!

243
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,554
Yeah!

244
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,031
Me, too! You!

245
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:30,397
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

246
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,602
And you, my friend, are royally...

247
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:13,306
Home.

248
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:26,928
Shrek!

249
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,598
Fiona!

250
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:35,937
Fiona?

251
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,559
Oh, no.

252
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:02,632
better out than in, I always say.

253
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,641
No, no, no!

254
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,374
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

255
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:25,816
Stop! Hey, wait!

256
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,731
Donkey. Donkey!

257
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,103
Wake up!

258
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:21,876
Dada!

259
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,307
Shrek! You okay?

260
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:33,582
I can't believe I'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

261
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:37,923
Allow me to explain. You see, when a man
has a certain feeling for a woman...

262
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,588
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

263
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:43,223
I know how it happened.

264
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,128
I just can't believe it.

265
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:50,738
How does it happen?

266
00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:03,016
~ And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon ~ 

267
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:05,782
~ Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon ~ 

268
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:08,518
~ When you coming home, son?
I don't know when ~ 

269
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,958
~ But we'll get together then, Dad. ~

270
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,087
Donkey! Can you just cut to the part

271
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:15,756
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

272
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:19,026
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

273
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,231
What I am talking about here
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

274
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:28,972
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

275
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:30,979
Don't listen to him!

276
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,812
Having a baby
is not going to ruin your life.

277
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:38,480
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's.

278
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:42,923
I mean, when have you ever heard the phrase
"as sweet as an ogre"...

279
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,495
...or "as nurturing as an ogre"...

280
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,999
...or how about "You're gonna love
my dad. He's a real ogre."

281
00:24:50,135 --> 00:24:51,898
Okay. Okay. I get it.

282
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:55,495
But nobody said it's going to be easy.
But at least you got us to help you.

283
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,335
That's true.

284
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:58,942
I'm doomed.

285
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,738
You'll be fine.

286
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,546
You're finished.

287
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,479
Uh, with your journey.

288
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:21,098
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"?
Now that sounds fancy!

289
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:22,563
It's Worcestershire.

290
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,532
Like the sauce? Hmmmmmm !

291
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:26,000
It's spicy! 

292
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,672
Oh, they must be expecting us.

293
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:40,380
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

294
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:45,717
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

295
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:47,017
High school?

296
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:48,716
Ready? Okay!

297
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,294
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

298
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,388
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

299
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:58,001
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

300
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:07,267
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

301
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:14,312
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

302
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,944
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

303
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:22,753
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of the underpants?

304
00:26:22,894 --> 00:26:25,795
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

305
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,991
So I was all like, "I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

306
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:32,467
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

307
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:35,402
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

308
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,602
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

309
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

310
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:46,975
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

311
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,314
I know you're busy not fiting in, but
can either of you tell me where I can find Arthur?

312
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,755
He's over there.

313
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:19,349
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

314
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:24,653
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

315
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:28,122
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

316
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:30,625
Sorry.

317
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,990
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

318
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,566
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

319
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:38,396
It's top secret!

320
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:42,131
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

321
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,269
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,969
This is your lucky day.

323
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,906
What are you supposed to be?

324
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:54,314
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

325
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,812
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

326
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,258
Unhand me, monster!

327
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:03,360
Stop squirming, Arthur.

328
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:05,827
I'm not Arthur.

329
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:10,357
I am Lancelot.

330
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:13,164
That dork over there is Arthur.

331
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,439
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

332
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:24,173
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

333
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:27,716
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

334
00:28:27,852 --> 00:28:28,944
Excuse me?

335
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:33,023
Like, whatever. She's totally into college guys
and mythical creatures.

336
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,554
Oh, Arthur...

337
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:42,393
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

338
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:47,063
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

339
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:50,606
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

340
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,045
Hold it.

341
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,775
We're here for the mascot contest.

342
00:29:05,456 --> 00:29:08,653
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

343
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,318
This is a costume?

344
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:13,453
Worked on it all night long.

345
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,596
Looks pretty real to me.

346
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:19,134
If he were real, could I do this?

347
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:22,466
Or this?

348
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:28,610
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

349
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,943
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

350
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,883
Thank you to Professor Primbotom
and his lecture...

351
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,419
...on "just say nay".

352
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:42,622
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

353
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,252
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

354
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:48,421
...ogre?

355
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,799
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

356
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:56,566
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

357
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,836
...whatever it is they're doing!

358
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:06,373
This is all a bit unorthodox...

359
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:10,180
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

360
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:13,947
Hey, wait...

361
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:19,689
Classic.

362
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,526
You should be ashamed of yourself!

363
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,066
I didn't do it. They did.

364
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:30,602
Please don't eat me.

365
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,074
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

366
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:36,740
I'm not here to eat him!

367
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,844
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

368
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:43,215
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

369
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:45,015
What?

370
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:50,755
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

371
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,489
Burn.

372
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:01,230
Is this for real?

373
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:05,775
Absolutely. Clean out your locker, kid.
You got a kingdom to run.

374
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,572
So, wait... l'm really the only heir?

375
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:11,245
The one and only.

376
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,244
Give me... just a second.

377
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,248
My good people...

378
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,119
...I think there's a lesson here for all of us.

379
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,559
Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think,

380
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,188
"Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

381
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,299
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

382
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:34,803
'Cause maybe... just maybe...

383
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:38,636
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

384
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:43,804
And maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

385
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:46,815
That's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team!

386
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:50,348
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

387
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,553
I've always loved you.

388
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:56,985
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

389
00:31:57,128 --> 00:32:00,620
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world baby!

390
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:02,357
Okay, let's not overdo it.

391
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,833
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

392
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,835
You just overdid it.

393
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,608
Look at you!

394
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,274
You look darling.

395
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:22,613
Just precious. Look at her.

396
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,120
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

397
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,884
No. Not at all.

398
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,455
Do you smell ham?

399
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:33,723
It's present time!

400
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,661
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's... It's the one in front.

401
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:44,434
"Congratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

402
00:32:44,575 --> 00:32:47,567
"Hopefully this helps.
Love, Cinderella."

403
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:50,574
- Look at that!
- What is it?

404
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,618
It's for the poopies.

405
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:56,310
Wait... babies poop?

406
00:32:56,454 --> 00:32:57,785
Everyone poops, Beauty.

407
00:32:57,922 --> 00:32:59,389
Fiona!

408
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:02,357
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

409
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,819
Ta-da!

410
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,863
You know the baby's gonna love it,
because I do!

411
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,969
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

412
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:13,502
Who's this one from?

413
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:16,573
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

414
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:19,767
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

415
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:24,240
What is it?

416
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:25,906
He's a live-in babysitter.

417
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,142
Where's the baby?

418
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:31,346
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

419
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,855
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

420
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,754
- What does he do?
- The cleaning.

421
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,485
- The feeding.
- The burping.

422
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:40,096
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

423
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:42,358
Now you have plenty of time
to work on your marriage.

424
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,368
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:50,531
Come on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

426
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,501
You're tired all the time.

427
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:55,373
You start leting yourself go.

428
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,673
Stretch marks.

429
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:58,145
Say goodbye to romance.

430
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:03,921
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

431
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:05,613
She's right!

432
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:10,193
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

433
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:13,161
How did Shrek react when you told him?
Tell me!

434
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,495
When he first found out, Shrek said...

435
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:34,682
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

436
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,519
Now... bombs away!

437
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,910
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

438
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:04,514
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

439
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:26,730
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

440
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:46,556
You go! Take care of the baby!

441
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:49,854
Everybody stay calm! We're all going to die!

442
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,392
Everyone in! Now!

443
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,661
Come on! Put some back into it!

444
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,496
We don't have time. Now go!

445
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,438
Quickly, ladies!

446
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:09,270
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

447
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:27,362
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

448
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:29,659
The name doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,495
No bell.

450
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:35,003
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

451
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,733
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

452
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:41,572
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

453
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:44,010
- Hook!
- Right!

454
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:46,378
Avast, ye cookie.

455
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:50,647
Start talking.

456
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:56,516
- Gingy!
- Papa!

457
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:58,026
Setle down now.

458
00:37:12,009 --> 00:37:15,308
On the good ship Lollipop

459
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,882
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

460
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,005
You!

461
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,046
You can't lie.

462
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:26,850
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

463
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,091
Well... I don't know where he's not.

464
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,425
You don't know where Shrek is?

465
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:38,160
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

466
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:42,568
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

467
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:44,072
So you do know where he is!

468
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,733
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

469
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:49,107
not definitely rejecting the idea

470
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:52,909
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

471
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,039
Stop it!

472
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,312
...I do not know where he shouldn't probably be.

473
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:58,922
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

474
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:02,651
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

475
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:05,023
On the good ship Lollipop

476
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:09,565
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

477
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,367
He's bringing back the next heir?

478
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:15,995
No!

479
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:20,438
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

480
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:22,443
But bring Shrek to me.

481
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,777
I have something special
in mind for him.

482
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,077
He'll never fall for your tricks!

483
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,415
Oh, boy.

484
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:44,291
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

485
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,461
I knew I came from royalty and all, but...

486
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,698
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

487
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,571
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

488
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:56,271
Really? Wow.

489
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:59,845
But I know it's not all fun and games.

490
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:02,976
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

491
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,715
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

492
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:11,191
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

493
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,126
Any idiot can hit a boat with the bottle.

494
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:17,900
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

495
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:20,003
This is going to be huge.

496
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:25,006
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

497
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:28,009
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

498
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:30,613
The got the finest chefs
will wait for your order.

499
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,717
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

500
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,546
What do they do?

501
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:40,282
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

502
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:43,018
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

503
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,687
Don't worry about it. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

504
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,095
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

505
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,066
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

506
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:53,636
Really?

507
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:56,797
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

508
00:39:57,174 --> 00:39:59,108
Make sure they don't die of famine!

509
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:00,972
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

510
00:40:01,111 --> 00:40:04,012
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

511
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:10,020
Festering sores!
You are one funny kity cat.

512
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,087
What did I say?

513
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,589
We don't want Artie
geting the wrong idea.

514
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,519
Artie?

515
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,561
There goes my hip!

516
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,861
Artie! What are you doing?

517
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:28,931
What does it look like?!

518
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:34,077
This really isn't up to you.

519
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:37,078
I don't know anything about being king!

520
00:40:37,214 --> 00:40:39,148
You'll learn on the job!

521
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:43,576
Sorry to disapoint you, but I'm going back.

522
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:46,155
Back to what? Being a loser?

523
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,285
Now look what you did!

524
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:55,896
Look what I did?
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

525
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,391
Shrek!

526
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,739
Land ho!

527
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:27,093
How humiliating.

528
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:31,033
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

529
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:34,865
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to "loser"?

530
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,906
If you think this is geting you
out of anything, well it isn't.

531
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:41,808
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

532
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,380
...and you're going to be a father!

533
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:45,948
What?

534
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,342
You just said "father".

535
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,215
King! You're going to be king!

536
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:54,347
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

537
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,992
Where do you think you are  going?

538
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,595
Far Far Away... from you!

539
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,698
You get back here, young man,
and I mean it !

540
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,158
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

541
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:09,500
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

542
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,871
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

543
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,843
Come on. Why would I do that?

544
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,040
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

545
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:23,142
Then you're gonna change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

546
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,320
You're right, Donkey.

547
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,184
What about this?

548
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:35,162
- Shrek!
- Come on. It's just a joke.

549
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,065
Still...

550
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,513
Listen, Artie.

551
00:42:57,087 --> 00:43:02,218
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

552
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,489
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof, or whatever.

553
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,757
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

554
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:12,096
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

555
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,329
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

556
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:17,406
ain't straight trippin',
say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

557
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,975
You're getting on my last nerve."

558
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,102
And then I'll know it's...
I'll know it's wack!

559
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:25,909
Somebody, help!

560
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,451
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

561
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:33,215
- Artie, wait.
- Come on! Help! Hello?

562
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:38,422
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

563
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:40,496
Welcome to my serenity circle.

564
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:44,761
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

565
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:46,733
Now prepare to...

566
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:55,242
I knew I should have got that warranty!

567
00:43:58,148 --> 00:43:59,615
Mr. Merlin?

568
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,217
You know this guy?

569
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:05,617
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

570
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:09,123
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

571
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:11,352
At the request of my therapist,

572
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:15,124
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

573
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:17,426
to discover my divine purpose.

574
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:22,337
Now, can I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

575
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:23,565
Uh, no.

576
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:27,040
Sure you don't want to try
my famous Rock Au Gratin?

577
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:31,414
It's organic.

578
00:44:31,548 --> 00:44:33,982
Thanks. I just ate a boulder on the way in.

579
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:37,053
What we need, are directions
back back to Far Far Away.

580
00:44:37,187 --> 00:44:39,712
"We"? Who said I was going with you?

581
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:44,226
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

582
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:46,420
If it's such a great job, you do it.

583
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:51,230
Understand this, kid. It's no more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

584
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:53,666
So, that was your Mr. Nice Guy?

585
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,738
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

586
00:44:55,873 --> 00:45:00,276
You know what ?
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

587
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,938
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

588
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:09,109
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

589
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:11,084
I could have tell you, but since you're

590
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,746
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

591
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,416
it would be karmically irresponsible.

592
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,223
Self-destructive?
Look, are you going to help us or not?

593
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,958
Most definitely, but only after you

594
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,297
take the journey to your soul!

595
00:45:26,436 --> 00:45:27,801
Yeah, I don't think so.

596
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:31,772
It's either that
or some primal scream therapy.

597
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,506
All right, all right.
Journey to the soul.

598
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,212
Now, all of you,

599
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:41,874
look into the Fire of Truth

600
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:45,011
and tell me what you see.

601
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:49,723
Ooh, charades!

602
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,627
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

603
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:57,359
Okay, monster... go for it.

604
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,738
I see a rainbow pony.

605
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:09,812
Excellent work! Now the boy.

606
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:11,414
This is lame.

607
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:13,812
You're lame! Now just go for it.

608
00:46:15,385 --> 00:46:16,716
Okay.

609
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:21,991
There's a baby bird and a father bird
siting in a nest.

610
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,116
Yes! Stay with it!

611
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:28,955
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the little bird all alone?

612
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:33,069
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

613
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:36,132
It's going to fall!

614
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:44,971
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

615
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,312
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

616
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:07,997
Look, Artie, um...

617
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:15,106
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

618
00:47:15,245 --> 00:47:18,578
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

619
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:30,357
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

620
00:47:32,696 --> 00:47:35,028
Even ogres get scared.

621
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:38,699
You know... once in a while.

622
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:44,470
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't.

623
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:47,475
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be, all right?

624
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:50,869
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

625
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:54,211
He dumped me at that school
the first chance he got...

626
00:47:54,885 --> 00:47:57,217
...and I never heard from him again.

627
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:02,723
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

628
00:48:03,226 --> 00:48:05,387
Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.

629
00:48:06,229 --> 00:48:07,526
Oh, yeah?

630
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:11,725
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

631
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:14,764
Now I guess I should have seen it coming.

632
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:19,171
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

633
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:23,569
Okay, I guess that's pretty bad.

634
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,111
you know, it may be hard to believe,

635
00:48:28,251 --> 00:48:31,709
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

636
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:34,790
but people used
to think I was a monster.

637
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:38,588
And for a long time, I believed them.

638
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:42,189
But after a while,

639
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:45,859
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

640
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:48,335
and you just trust who you are.

641
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,603
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

642
00:48:54,444 --> 00:48:58,005
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

643
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:00,976
Thanks, Artie.

644
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:04,781
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

645
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:08,447
Yeah... I got that.

646
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:15,329
This place is filthy!

647
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:17,224
I feel like a hobo.

648
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:21,232
I'm sorry, but this
isn't just working for me.

649
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:25,933
Everything's always about you, isn't it.
Something in your attitude is not helping.

650
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:29,773
Maybe it just bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

651
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,006
Oh you mean in that rigged election?

652
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:35,118
Oh give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

653
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:38,380
...let down thy golden extensions!"

654
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:43,323
Ladies, let go of your pety complaints
and let's work together!

655
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,288
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

656
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:51,526
in this stinkhole until we rot.

657
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:55,195
No, we get inside and find out
what Charming's up to.

658
00:49:55,338 --> 00:49:58,034
I know he's a jerk and everything,

659
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:02,339
but that Charming
makes me hotter than July.

660
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,011
That's it!

661
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:35,409
Come on! This way!

662
00:50:35,545 --> 00:50:36,534
Rapunzel, wait!

663
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:47,887
Charming, let go of her.

664
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,652
But why would I want to do that?

665
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,188
What?

666
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:02,431
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

667
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,240
Rapunzel, how could you?

668
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:10,642
Jealous much?

669
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,214
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

670
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,978
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

671
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:19,748
That is, if I let you last the week.

672
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:24,652
But Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

673
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:28,787
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

674
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:32,058
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

675
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,467
Shrek will be back soon, Charming
and you'll be sorry.

676
00:51:35,605 --> 00:51:37,004
Sorry?!

677
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,406
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

678
00:51:41,545 --> 00:51:43,308
...he's doomed?

679
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,479
Look out! They got a piano!

680
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,988
Kill them all... except the fat one.

681
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:32,493
King Charming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

682
00:52:32,629 --> 00:52:33,926
King Charming?

683
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:35,088
Attack!

684
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:42,531
Artie, duck!

685
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:58,349
Ready the plank!

686
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,731
- Shrek!
- Help!

687
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:36,355
Cowards!

688
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,859
What has Charming done with Fiona?

689
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:41,589
She's gonna get what's coming to her.

690
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:47,068
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

691
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:49,728
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

692
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,972
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

693
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:56,601
No, Shrek. Hold on a second.
I've got an idea.

694
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:59,010
I am a buzzing bee.

695
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:02,880
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

696
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:06,045
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

697
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,625
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore, kid.

698
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:13,456
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

699
00:54:13,596 --> 00:54:15,962
Mr merlin, please. I know you can do it.

700
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,896
I said forget it!

701
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,365
But...

702
00:54:26,776 --> 00:54:28,368
What's with you?

703
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:32,876
It's just so hard, you know?

704
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,680
They really need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

705
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:40,346
'Cause there's a really bad man.

706
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,253
And it's just so hard!

707
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:44,519
Take it easy.

708
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:48,028
No! I don't think you understand!

709
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:52,692
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

710
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:54,531
Have a heart, old man.

711
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:58,835
They really need your help to get them back.
So why won't you help them?!

712
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,271
Okay.

713
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,405
I'll go get my things.

714
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:10,379
Piece of cake.

715
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,047
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

716
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,887
I am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

717
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:19,494
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

718
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:23,395
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful it may be,

719
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:26,696
it will wear off eventually. I think.

720
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:30,901
- Oops.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

721
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,170
Look, if Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

722
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:37,176
Even if his robe doesn't quite cover...

723
00:55:37,313 --> 00:55:39,838
Alacritious... Expeditious...

724
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:42,679
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

725
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:45,652
Let's help our friends get back...

726
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:49,722
...soon!

727
00:55:57,066 --> 00:55:58,658
It worked!

728
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:10,403
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

729
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,109
Donkey?

730
00:56:12,248 --> 00:56:15,081
What? Is something in my teeth?

731
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,514
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

732
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:28,922
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated roasted pi�ata!

733
00:56:29,065 --> 00:56:31,124
You should think about going on a diet!

734
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:35,863
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

735
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,872
So you two think this is funny?

736
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,175
I'm really sorry, guys.

737
00:56:44,314 --> 00:56:46,782
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

738
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,582
How in the Hans Christian Andersen

739
00:56:54,724 --> 00:56:57,488
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

740
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,460
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

741
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:05,231
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

742
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,893
You'll learn to control that.

743
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:15,801
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

744
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:26,854
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

745
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,082
Pinocchio!

746
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:30,850
Shrek! Help me!

747
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:34,191
- What happened?
- Charming and the villains
have taken over everything!

748
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,096
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
And now she's...

749
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:39,758
She's what?! What?!

750
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:43,936
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

751
00:57:44,073 --> 00:57:46,303
You heard him. Help the brother out.

752
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:48,535
Do you see any pockets on me?

753
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:50,509
Hold on a second.

754
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:57,180
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

755
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:00,549
Quick Pinocchio! Where is Fiona?

756
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,456
Charming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

757
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:07,461
He's probably getting ready
for the show!

758
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:09,929
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

759
00:58:14,938 --> 00:58:17,338
"It's a Happily Ever After After All".

760
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:19,805
"Shrek's final performance"?

761
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:24,073
Wow, Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

762
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,671
Well I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

763
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,375
It's the ogre! Get him!

764
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,052
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

765
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,223
Uck! Kill it!

766
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:47,362
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

767
00:58:47,503 --> 00:58:49,027
Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.

768
00:58:49,172 --> 00:58:54,109
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

769
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:55,767
I'm going to lose it!

770
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:59,712
I assume everything is ready for tonight?
You did get the list for the dressing room?

771
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,943
yeah, the breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

772
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:06,385
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey buter.

773
00:59:06,522 --> 00:59:09,514
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

774
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:11,456
without jalapeno honey buter!

775
00:59:11,594 --> 00:59:12,993
I just lost it.

776
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:16,288
maybe they should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

777
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:19,924
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

778
00:59:21,604 --> 00:59:25,301
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

779
00:59:25,441 --> 00:59:29,104
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

780
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:32,481
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

781
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:34,480
I don't think that's a word, actually.

782
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:38,951
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

783
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:43,286
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

784
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:48,430
"Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

785
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:52,227
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
it just doesn't feel real enough yet!

786
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:56,162
Who told you to stop dancing?!

787
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:57,772
Wink and turn.

788
00:59:57,907 --> 01:00:01,138
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

789
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:13,016
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

790
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,351
And I assure you...

791
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:20,485
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

792
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:23,325
...we've had to wait.

793
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:26,367
Break a leg.

794
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,266
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

795
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:33,705
Thank goodness, you're here. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

796
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:35,470
Where's Fiona?

797
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:39,843
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

798
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:52,358
Let me guess. Arthur.

799
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:55,054
It's Artie, actually.

800
01:00:55,198 --> 01:01:00,192
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

801
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,402
How pathetic.

802
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:06,406
Now, stand still, so I won't make a mess.

803
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:09,978
Charming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

804
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:11,774
This isn't about him.

805
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:16,882
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

806
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:22,590
You weren't really next in line
for the throne, okay.

807
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:24,124
I was.

808
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,593
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

809
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,561
Not exactly.

810
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,132
What that supposed to mean?

811
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:33,758
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

812
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:37,600
I wasn't right for the job,
I just needed some fool to replace me.

813
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,403
And you fit the bill. So... So just go!

814
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,539
You were playing me the whole time.

815
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:48,445
You catch on real fast, kid.

816
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:51,678
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

817
01:01:58,094 --> 01:02:00,460
You know, for a minute there...

818
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:02,496
...I actually thought...
- What?

819
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:06,124
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

820
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:08,100
What did you expect?

821
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,107
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

822
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:38,263
~ Leave me out with the waste ~ 

823
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:41,336
~ This is not what I do ~ 

824
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:45,167
~ It's the wrong time ~ 

825
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:48,004
~ She's pulling me through ~ 

826
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:51,841
~ It's a small crime ~ 

827
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:54,609
~ And I got no excuse ~ 

828
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,150
~ And is that all right, yeah? ~

829
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:00,646
~ Is that all right with you? ~

830
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,824
~ Is that all right, yeah? ~

831
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:10,322
~ If I give my gun away when it's loaded? ~

832
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:17,165
~ If you don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it? ~

833
01:03:20,343 --> 01:03:23,210
~ Is that all right?
Is that all right? ~

834
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:26,782
~ Is that all right with you? ~

835
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:27,383
~ No. ~

836
01:03:27,383 --> 01:03:27,781
~ No. ~

837
01:03:28,117 --> 01:03:29,948
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

838
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,884
we could be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

839
01:03:33,022 --> 01:03:34,546
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

840
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,318
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

841
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,052
Yeah, loganberries.

842
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:41,060
- Shut up, Cindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

843
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:44,064
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

844
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,998
Who cares who's "running the kingdom" anyway?

845
01:03:47,136 --> 01:03:50,367
- I care.
- And you should all care too.

846
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:57,244
I have your badge number, tin can!

847
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,245
- Donkey?
- Princess!

848
01:03:59,382 --> 01:04:00,371
Puss?

849
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:04,577
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

850
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,744
And I'm me!

851
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,014
But you're...

852
01:04:07,156 --> 01:04:09,818
I know, I know, everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

853
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,927
we went to high school,
and the boat crashed

854
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:14,621
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

855
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:16,959
You poor sweet things.

856
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:18,498
I don't get it.

857
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:22,365
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

858
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:23,870
Who dat?

859
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,030
Where's Shrek?

860
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:29,167
Charming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

861
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:34,743
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

862
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:38,411
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

863
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,486
What are you doing?

864
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:46,626
Waiting to be rescued.

865
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,730
You've got to be kidding me.

866
01:04:48,864 --> 01:04:51,628
What do you expect us to do? We're just four...

867
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:55,066
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

868
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:59,265
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

869
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:04,443
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

870
01:05:13,055 --> 01:05:14,852
Mom!

871
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:19,257
You didn't actually think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

872
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:22,125
Excuse me. I think there's still one more.

873
01:05:32,308 --> 01:05:34,640
Why don't you just lie down?

874
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:40,180
Okay, girls, from here on out...

875
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,784
...we're gonna take care of business ourselves.

876
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:04,363
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Far Far Away Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

877
01:06:04,507 --> 01:06:06,270
..."It's A Happily Ever After
After AII."

878
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:09,708
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

879
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:13,178
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

880
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,394
Places, everyone!

881
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:34,662
Easy!

882
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:38,706
Sorry. I guess I was showing off
for the little one.

883
01:06:39,442 --> 01:06:43,037
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Come here, beautiful.

884
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:49,207
Well, she's got your eye.

885
01:06:50,453 --> 01:06:55,390
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

886
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:40,092
~ Little birdies, take wing ~ 

887
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,564
~ Flitting down from the trees they appear ~ 

888
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:46,174
~ And to chirp in my ear ~ 

889
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:50,435
~ All because I sing ~ 

890
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:21,133
Move it! Go!

891
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,479
My babies!

892
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:31,475
Help!

893
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:19,023
Hey, how's it goin'?

894
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:31,646
O to the K. The coast is clear.

895
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:34,408
All right people, let's do this thing.
Go, Team Dynamite!

896
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:38,384
I thought we agreed go by the name
Team Super Cool.

897
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,750
I recall it was Team Awesome.

898
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,823
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

899
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,926
All right, all right, all right!
From henceforth,

900
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,190
We will be known as Team Alpha Super Awesome
Cool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

901
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:53,563
Ach de liebe! There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!

902
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,868
Artie!

903
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,370
Wait, wait!

904
01:09:57,506 --> 01:09:59,701
Where is the fire, se�or?

905
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:01,867
Please. Don't act so innocent.

906
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:05,777
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

907
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:07,506
Artie, it's not like it seems.

908
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,483
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

909
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:13,144
He was using me. That's all.

910
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:15,723
Using you? You really don't get it.

911
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:18,850
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

912
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:24,192
Charming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

913
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:36,369
Cue the spot!

914
01:10:40,215 --> 01:10:42,740
~ I wait alone up here ~ 

915
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:45,581
~ I'm trapped another day ~ 

916
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:48,918
~ Locked up here, please set me free ~ 

917
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:52,084
~ My new life I almost see ~ 

918
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:54,923
~ A castle, you and me ~ 

919
01:10:55,064 --> 01:11:00,161
~ Yes, a castle, you and me ~ 

920
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:03,295
Cherubs!

921
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:11,042
~ Tis I, Tis I
Upon my regal steed ~ 

922
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,807
~ Princess, my love ~ 

923
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:15,712
~ At last you shall be freed
I'm strong ~ 

924
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:17,819
~ And brave
And dashing my way there ~ 

925
01:11:18,253 --> 01:11:23,919
~ With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair! ~

926
01:11:24,893 --> 01:11:28,659
~ - Through the blistering desert
- Hot! ~

927
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:31,823
~ - Across the stormiest sea
- Wet! ~

928
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:33,958
~ Facing creatures so vile ~ 

929
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:35,229
~ Foul! ~

930
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:39,501
~ So you can gaze upon me! ~

931
01:11:40,809 --> 01:11:43,141
~ I knew you'd come for me ~ 

932
01:11:43,278 --> 01:11:47,112
~ And now we finally meet ~ 

933
01:11:47,249 --> 01:11:48,716
~ I knew you'd wait ~ 

934
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:53,379
~ And from my plate of love you'd eat ~ 

935
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:16,641
~ Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened? ~

936
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:18,610
~ Will Charming fight or flee? ~

937
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:19,805
~ Oh please rescue me! ~

938
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:21,643
~ From this monstrosity! ~

939
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:26,812
~ Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham! ~

940
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,457
Oh, boy.

941
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:33,186
~ You are about to enter a world of pain ~ 

942
01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:37,662
~ With which you are not familiar! ~

943
01:12:41,103 --> 01:12:45,506
Well, it can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance you're giving.

944
01:12:49,178 --> 01:12:51,169
"Prepare, foul beast."

945
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:56,547
~ Prepare, foul beast, your time is done! ~

946
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:59,848
Could you kill me and then sing?

947
01:13:01,356 --> 01:13:03,051
Be quiet!

948
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:07,322
Come on, I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

949
01:13:07,463 --> 01:13:08,725
Thank you.

950
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:10,957
Do they come in men's sizes?

951
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:15,765
Now that be funny!

952
01:13:15,904 --> 01:13:17,872
Enough!

953
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:24,075
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

954
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:27,740
...to have everything you worked for...

955
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:31,910
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

956
01:13:32,054 --> 01:13:35,387
Now you'll know how I felt.

957
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:44,392
Sausage roll!

958
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:04,275
Pray for mercy from Puss!

959
01:14:04,419 --> 01:14:05,909
And Donkey!

960
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:07,179
D

961
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,462
Hi, honey.

962
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:22,627
Sorry we're late. You okay?

963
01:14:22,771 --> 01:14:25,103
Much better, now that you're here.

964
01:14:27,776 --> 01:14:32,975
So, Charming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

965
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:37,449
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a better idea.

966
01:14:53,302 --> 01:14:55,702
- Fiona !
- No! Let go of me!

967
01:14:55,837 --> 01:14:59,967
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

968
01:15:03,812 --> 01:15:05,575
Everybody, stop!

969
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,509
Oh, what is it now?!

970
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:10,913
Artie?

971
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:23,064
Who really thinks we need
to settle things this way?

972
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:31,033
You're telling me you want to be villains
your whole lives?

973
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:34,973
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

974
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,544
Did you never wish
you could be something else?

975
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,137
It's easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

976
01:15:41,283 --> 01:15:44,047
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

977
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:46,984
What Steve's trying too say is
it's hard to come by honest work

978
01:15:47,122 --> 01:15:49,147
when the whole world's against you.

979
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,020
Right. Thanks, Ed.

980
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:55,562
Okay, fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

981
01:15:55,697 --> 01:15:56,789
But you know...

982
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:00,060
...a good friend of mine once told me...

983
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:05,230
...that just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

984
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:07,365
...or just some loser...

985
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:10,777
...doesn't mean you are one.

986
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:17,517
The thing that matters most
is what you think of yourself.

987
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:21,953
If there's something you really want,
or someone you really want to be...

988
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:25,719
...then the only person standing
in your way is you.

989
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,991
- Me?
- Get him!

990
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,529
No, no, no!

991
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:32,600
What I mean is each of you...

992
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:34,998
...is standing in your own way.

993
01:16:38,907 --> 01:16:41,398
I always wanted to play the flute.

994
01:16:41,543 --> 01:16:45,206
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

995
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:49,909
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

996
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:41,796
A new era finally begins!

997
01:17:43,638 --> 01:17:45,299
Now all of you...

998
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:48,541
...bow before your King!

999
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:57,315
You need to work on your aim.

1000
01:17:59,654 --> 01:18:02,521
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1001
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:05,148
Now I guess you need to keep looking...

1002
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:09,221
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1003
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:15,663
Mommy?

1004
01:18:27,015 --> 01:18:29,176
It's yours if you want it you know.

1005
01:18:29,851 --> 01:18:32,183
But this time it's your choice.

1006
01:18:54,876 --> 01:18:55,900
Author!

1007
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:59,377
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1008
01:19:03,718 --> 01:19:06,710
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1009
01:19:07,722 --> 01:19:12,489
Okay, Se�or Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!

1010
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:15,152
Although I have been enjoying
these cat baths.

1011
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:16,787
Please say you didn't.

1012
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,832
All right, all right! Look.

1013
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:22,266
You're gonna feel a little pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1014
01:19:22,404 --> 01:19:24,736
...but this should do the trick.

1015
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:31,445
- Are you?
- I'm me again!

1016
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,844
- And I am not you!
- All right!

1017
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:36,577
Oops.

1018
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:39,986
Ah, never mind.

1019
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:48,053
What did I tell you?
I think the kid's going to be a great king.

1020
01:19:48,196 --> 01:19:51,757
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1021
01:19:53,268 --> 01:19:56,260
I have something
much more important in mind.

1022
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:23,024
Finally.

1023
01:20:29,804 --> 01:20:31,135
Dada.

1024
01:20:33,241 --> 01:20:37,610
~ Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place ~ 

1025
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:40,237
I smell Shrek Junior!

1026
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:43,044
~ Where else could a creep like me ~ 

1027
01:20:43,184 --> 01:20:45,914
~ Meet such a pretty face ~ 

1028
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:49,990
~ Meeting every day with the rising sun ~ 

1029
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:55,695
~ Looking up, it's looking like ~ 

1030
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,492
~ My losing streak is done ~ 

1031
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:00,698
Peek-a-boo!

1032
01:21:00,835 --> 01:21:02,166
Peek-a-boo!

1033
01:21:05,373 --> 01:21:07,204
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1034
01:21:07,342 --> 01:21:10,038
~ Used to always feel like ~ 

1035
01:21:10,178 --> 01:21:12,840
~ Wished that I was dressed better ~ 

1036
01:21:13,848 --> 01:21:15,509
Where's the baby?

1037
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:20,019
~ Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her ~ 

1038
01:21:29,531 --> 01:21:33,524
~ Meeting every day with the rising sun ~ 

1039
01:21:36,204 --> 01:21:38,365
~ Looking up, it's looking like ~ 

1040
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,873
~ My losing streak is done ~ 

1041
01:21:44,045 --> 01:21:46,377
~ My losing streak is done ~ 

1042
01:21:57,225 --> 01:21:59,887
Well... what shall we do now?

1043
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:17,571
I got it.

1044
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:28,454
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1045
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:33,220
~ I want to thank you for letting me
be myself ~ 

1046
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:34,453
~ Again! ~

1047
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:36,461
~ Look at my hips! ~

1048
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:41,797
~ I want to thank you for letting me
be myself ~ 

1049
01:22:41,936 --> 01:22:43,426
~ Again! ~

1050
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:50,234
~ - Break it down!
- Let's go! ~

1051
01:22:50,378 --> 01:22:52,778
~ Stiff all in the collar ~ 

1052
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:56,777
~ Fluffy in the face ~ 

1053
01:22:58,953 --> 01:23:01,444
~ Chit chat chatter trying ~ 

1054
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,952
~ Stuffy in the place ~ 

1055
01:23:07,128 --> 01:23:09,961
~ Thank you for the par-tay ~ 

1056
01:23:11,132 --> 01:23:12,997
~ But I could never stay ~ 

1057
01:23:13,134 --> 01:23:14,465
~ I'm sorry. ~

1058
01:23:15,136 --> 01:23:18,128
~ I got many things on my mind ~ 

1059
01:23:19,474 --> 01:23:21,635
~ But the word's in the way ~ 

1060
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:27,843
~ And I want to thank you for letting me
be myself ~ 

1061
01:23:27,982 --> 01:23:29,313
~ Again ~ 

1062
01:23:30,318 --> 01:23:32,286
~ Different strokes for different folks ~ 

1063
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:36,015
~ Thank you for letting me be myself ~ 

1064
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:37,647
~ Again ~ 

1065
01:23:39,828 --> 01:23:41,318
~ Break it down! ~

1066
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:45,493
~ Puss and Donkey, baby!
Puss and Donkey, baby! ~

1067
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,661
~ Puss and Donkey, baby! ~

1068
01:23:49,003 --> 01:23:51,164
~ Dance to the music ~ 

1069
01:23:53,007 --> 01:23:55,339
~ All night long ~ 

1070
01:23:57,345 --> 01:23:59,677
~ Everyday people ~ 

1071
01:24:01,349 --> 01:24:03,510
~ Sing a simple song ~ 

1072
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,011
~ Mama's so happy ~ 

1073
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:11,849
~ Mama start to cry ~ 

1074
01:24:14,028 --> 01:24:16,519
~ Papa's still singing ~ 

1075
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:21,191
~ You can make it if you try
So try! ~

1076
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:26,238
~ Thank you for letting me be myself ~ 

1077
01:24:26,374 --> 01:24:27,705
~ Again ~ 

1078
01:24:30,712 --> 01:24:34,580
~ Thank you for letting me be myself ~ 

1079
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:36,411
~ Again ~ 

1080
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:39,418
~ Come on, Donkey. Do something right! ~

1081
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,954
~ Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together! ~

1082
01:24:43,057 --> 01:24:47,255
~ Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your
boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby! ~

1083
01:24:47,395 --> 01:24:51,263
~ Thank you for letting me be myself ~ 

1084
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:52,889
~ Again ~ 

1085
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:59,597
~ I want to thank you for letting me
be myself ~ 

1086
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:00,833
~ Again ~ 

1087
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:03,944
~ Thank you, thank you, thank you. ~

1088
01:25:04,078 --> 01:25:07,275
~ Want to thank you
Just to be my ~ 

1089
01:25:07,415 --> 01:25:10,282
~ Because I just want to be my...
See? ~

1090
01:25:10,418 --> 01:25:13,114
~ Can I, can I thank you!
Can I ~ 

1091
01:25:13,254 --> 01:25:15,085
~ Yes! Yes! ~
